The **Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics** is excited to offer a *** two-week summer course on the
integration of multi-scale neuroscience data*** - encompassing **genetics**, **brain structure and function**, and **cognition** –
designed to introduce participants to the concepts and methods behind psychiatric neuroinformatics. Daily sessions will
include both didactic teaching and hands-on tutorial components aimed at engaging critical thinking and developing
practical skills in key selected areas. Through a series of experiments using real-world data types, participants will
uncover the links between modalities of human genomics, neuronal electrophysiology, structural and functional
neuroimaging, and observed behaviour that KCNI scientists are integrating to study mental illness.

All participants will take part in each full day of training. While the course is designed with a unified dataset and shared
series of tutorials, students will have the opportunity for *project-specific discussions*, *collaboration*, and *guidance*
outside of structured time. Lectures will be led by members and affiliates of the KCNI team, including faculty at the
University of Toronto’s Department of Psychiatry.

This unique course will prepare participants to handle and analyze multiple data types in hopes that their own research
may benefit from collaborative, multi-modal approaches. Critically, participants will also learn about best practices for
data management and quality control in the context of integrative analysis as well as ethical considerations. Students will explore the ethical dimensions of data collection, curation and model building and their impact on fairness and health equity using concrete tools and best practices

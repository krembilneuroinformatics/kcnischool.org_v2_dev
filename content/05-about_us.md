## Solving the human question of mental health

The team at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinfomatics is putting today’s most advanced technology to work on this universal task that will unlock the power of personalized medicine to change the world.


With CAMH’s unique position as a data-driven organization and a leading mental health hospital, #KrembilNeuroinformatics is tackling the problem with an unprecedented approach.
 

Taking all of the data that exists in, about and around a person—everything from their cellular makeup to sleep patterns—to create personalized brain models and make predictions about mental health. 

What we are doing is unique across the globe and will lead to more precise treatments for patients, which means better outcomes and faster recovery.

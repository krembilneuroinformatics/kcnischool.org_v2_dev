## Eligibility and prerequisites: 

Applications from graduate students, post-graduate research and clinical fellows, as well as early-career scientists will be considered. 

To ensure that all attendees can fully follow and benefit from the practical assignments, some minimal and demonstrable experience in R and Python is a minimum requirement. 

No previous formal training in psychiatry or informatics is necessary, however - and researchers from diverse backgrounds (e.g. medicine, computer science, biology, psychology, engineering etc.) are encouraged to apply.
